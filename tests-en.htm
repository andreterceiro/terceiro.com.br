            Well, do or don't do tests? Well, first I want to explain my positionand I hope that you understand. <br />
            I prefer to not do tests to not loose time. Why?  <br />
            Normally I am very busy and do a test that in a lot of times don't have a feedback is nonsense. <br />
            I think you want to several candidates do the same test to ake the comparison more easy.<br />
            Ok, is really more easy... But, no offenses, I don't want to loose my time.<br />
            I don't receive a feedback several times. Some tests involve a lot of work (ok, other not).<br />
            Do you want to see my code? I have references (references.txt in this site), almost 600 Katas in Codewars,<br />
            more than  100 repositories in Github, courses, images, text and certifications in LinkedIN. I think it is ok. Help-me please.
